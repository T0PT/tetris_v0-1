Hi there!
i wanted to try out rust an have a quick look on how does it work. So, i figured out, i just would create a simple tetris game in it.
I've used a crossterm crate for the somewhat simple input detection and the rest is written by me, i guess.
Feel free to comment it or leave feedback! 
**Enjoy!**
