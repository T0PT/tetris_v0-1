Hi there!
I wanted to try out rust and have a quick look on how does it work. So, i figured out, i just would create a simple tetris game in it.
It took about three not full days of my holidays to complete it, which is, i guess, fine for such a noob like me :) 
I've used a crossterm crate for the somewhat simple input detection and the rest is written by me, i guess.
Feel free to comment it or leave feedback! 
**Enjoy!**
